# About this Repo

This is a fork of the official consul docker container definition.

Notable changes include:

* The installation of the tool `jo`.
* During build, the GPG keyserver is specified.
* The entry script includes optional directives to disable remote execution, set the master ACL token, and set an encryption key.

# License
